## Introduction

*Super ZEE* is a pixel-art platformer game where players embody "Zee" an ALX Software Engineering student. The game mirrors the real-life ALX journey, with each level representing a sprint or month in the SE program. Players must collect exams, avoid the KIMBA and Checker traps, and score 70% or higher before the timer runs out to advance to the next level. Built in Python using the Pygame library, *Super ZEE* combines engaging gameplay with a personal narrative of overcoming challenges and growth in the ALX program.
